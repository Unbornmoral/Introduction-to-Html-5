                <p>Hi there! I'm Alanwoko, a creative soul with a passion
                     for Coding. I thrive on turning ideas 
                     into reality.
                     Welcome to my little corner of the web!". 
                     you can find more about me in the 
                     <a href="http://wa.me/+2348162789938">about</a> 
                     section :)</p>
            <h3>ABOUT</h3>
                    <p>My name is Alanwoko Chikanma Chukwuka and yes, i am an introvert. so please don't be 
                        surprised by the inactivity in the shared social links.
                        I am a student who loves coding, football, sports basically.
                        I am Nigerian and the declining or sorry state of the country has made me take interests in 
                        coding. With a background of Political knowledge as being
                        a student of political science, I am able to predict the future outcomes
                        of poltical events. So, my goal is to incoporate programming
                        and computer analysis to the political sector with the aim 
                        to accurately predict future political events. By the way,
                        I don't watch the news :):). Just joking.
                        So, join me in this interesting journey to accomplish this
                    </p>
